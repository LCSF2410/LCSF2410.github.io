Hey, everybody. Kevin at Woodcraft here.

2
00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
And today we're going to make one of these cheese slicer kits.

3
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
These make great quick last minute gifts.

4
00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
And they're one of my favorite ways to use up offcuts.

5
00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
In fact, I've got this piece of Sarari Rosewood

6
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
that was already almost the perfect size.

7
00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
It's about seven inches long

8
00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
and a trimmed it down to four and three quarter inches wide

9
00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
because I'm going to be using one of our smaller kits.

10
00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
If you're using one of the large kit, all the steps are gonna be the same,

11
00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
but your measurements will vary.

12
00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
So be sure to refer to the instructions that come with your kit.

13
00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
First thing we have to do is drill a quarter inch hole on the end of the board.

14
00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Two and 7/8 inches deep.

15
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
In order to locate that hole, we're going to measure on the right

16
00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
end of the board, four and a quarter inches out to the far side.

17
00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
You can set up a fence to do this on your drill press,

18
00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
but you want to make sure your hole centered.

19
00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
So one of my favorite ways to do this is with a doweling jig,

20
00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
you won't be able to get the full depth with the doweling jig on,

21
00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
so you're going to go most of the way, take the jig off,

22
00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
and then use that hole as a guide to drill the rest of the way.

23
00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
A little side note here.

24
00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
On the large kit you need a hole that’s three and 7/8 inches deep.

25
00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
That's longer than most bits I've come across, even without the doweling jig.

26
01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
So I personally like to use this ten inch long bit from fish.

27
01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Now, once we've drilled our hole,

28
01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
we're going to measure from the side with the hole two inches in,

29
01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
and we're gonna make a single saw curve on the face of the board.

30
01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Now the instructions say 3/8 of an inch thick,

31
01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
but depending on how thick your material is

32
01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
and how centered you have that hole, it might change.

33
01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
We want the blade to be just a hair above that hole that we drilled,

34
01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
because when we slide the hardware in,

35
01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
we need room for the wire to fit over the hardware.

36
01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Now, to make it a little nicer, we'll give it an edge treatment.

37
01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And as much as I love chamfers, I think a round over looks really great

38
01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
on these cheese slicers.

39
01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Then you're going to sand it like normal, because this is a kitchen kit

40
01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
and it's going to come into contact with food.

41
01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You're going to want to wash it,

42
01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
so make sure to raise the grain while you're sanding.

43
01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
When it comes to finish,

44
01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
you can absolutely just treat this like a cutting board

45
01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
and use your mineral oil and your beeswax and you'll be totally fine.

46
01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
But technically,

47
01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
since you're not actually cutting on the wood,

48
01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
you could do something a little more durable if you wanted to.

49
01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Now for final assembly, you'll notice

50
02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
your hardware bar has a long end and a short end with a hole in it.

51
02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
We're going to put the handle onto the short end with the hole in it,

52
02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
but we're not going to install the set

53
02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
screw yet

54
02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
then we’ll take the long end and we're going to feed it

55
02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
through the hole that we drilled.

56
02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Just until we see it

57
02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
show up in the kerf, then we’re going to take the other end of that wire

58
02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
and loop it around the bar and push it the rest of the way in.

59
02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
We're going to rotate that handle up

60
02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
to tension the wire and now you install that screw.

61
02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
You may have to pull the bar out a little bit

62
02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
so that your wire lines up with that kerf cut.

63
02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Now you're ready to cut the cheese.

64
02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
If you'd like to pick up some of these cheese slicer

65
02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
kits or anything else for your woodworking need, be sure
